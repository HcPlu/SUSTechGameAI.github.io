                            <p>WCCI is the world’s largest technical event on computational intelligence, featuring the
                                three flagship conferences of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society under one
                                roof: The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),
                                the IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE) and the IEEE Congress on
                                Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC). WCCI 2024 will be held in Yokohama, Japan. Yokohama
                                is a city that inspires academic fusion and multidisciplinary
                                & industrial association. The Yokohama area boasts a number of universities, institutes
                                and companies of advanced information technology, electronics, robotics, mobility,
                                medicine and foods. WCCI 2024 held in this area will strongly inspire
                                the attendees to imagine next-generation science and technology as the fusion of AI,
                                physiology and psychology as well as a cooperation with intelligence-related industries.

                                    competition proposals from the community and industry. Traditionally, at WCCI2024,
                                    there are three types of competitions, depending on entry requirements from the
                                    competition participants:
                                <ul class="lst1">

                                        </b> each participating team submits a paper via the conference system that
                                        describes
                                        the method and the results obtained for solving the task given by the
                                        competition. The
                                        papers will be reviewed as any other paper
                                        submitted to WCCI2024. In this type of competition, the winner are commonly
                                        decided
                                        during the review stage among the accepted papers, while at the conference
                                        participants
                                        of accepted papers present their papers during a (special) session. At the
                                        end of the session, the session chairs (i.e., competition organizers) announce
                                        the
                                        winner(s). An example of type A competition would be developing most

                                        competition, but this is not mandatory. The submitted papers will be reviewed as
                                        any other papers submitted to WCCI2024. During the conference, the participants
                                        demonstrate their solutions, which are evaluated by a jury. After demonstrations
                                        conclude, the jury announces the winner of the competition. Moreover, those
                                        teams who submitted papers will present accepted papers at the conference (e.g.,
                                        during a special session). An example of a type B competition is tic-tac-toe

                                        of this competition. An example of a type C competition is tic-tac-toe
                                        competition, where competition entries compete against each other.

                                Once the competition is accepted for the conference, the competition organizers are
                                responsible for its publicity. The accepted competitions will be announced on the
                                conference website, but the conference organizers will not be able to advertise
                                individual competitions.<br>
                                In addition, the competition organizers are responsible for maintaining the competition
                                website and answering questions from the potential participants.<br>
                                WCCI 2024 will arrange winning certificates and may be able to support small prizes. We
                                strongly encourage competition organizers to engage with sponsors to support their
                                competitions. (All sponsors must be declared as part of the competition proposals or
                                approved separately by the competitions chair.)<br>
                                Competition Award Prize can be applied from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.
